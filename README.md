Cameras and Microphones Are All You Need

## WARNING

I believe that AI systems must be fully integrated into your environment to truly enhance its users. 
This causes issues when building ML and LLMs into products because you must violate all privacy of the user.

Realizing this, I have decided to build it myself. Anyone is welcome to use my R&D, but dont come crying to me when your entire life is somehow leaked online. 

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Overview

- Step 1: Mount cameras and microphones in all rooms you regularly use at your home or office.
- Step 2: Connect all input devices to your machine using OBS (or whatever you prefer).
- Step 3: Record/Stream to your machine.
- Step 4: Ask questions about events in any room in your house.
